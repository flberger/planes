README for Click'n'Drag
=======================

About
-----

Click'n'Drag is a hierarchical surface framework for PyGame.

The clickndrag module introduces the "Plane" class which extends PyGame's 
"Surface" functionality, offering a hierarchy of mouse-sensitive, draggable 
Surfaces that can be used as sprites, windows, icons or other interactive 
elements.

In addition, the clickndrag.gui module uses clickndrag to provide basic GUI 
elements like container, label, text box, option list and button.
