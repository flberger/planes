README for planes
=================

About
-----

planes is a hierarchical surface framework for PyGame, extending it
with a hierarchy of mouse-sensitive, draggable Surfaces that can be
used as sprites, windows, icons or other interactive elements.

In addition, the planes.gui module provides basic GUI elements like
container, label, text box, option list and button.

planes is quite powerful, but sadly lacks a tutorial to get started.
This will be added in the beta (0.9.x) releases.
